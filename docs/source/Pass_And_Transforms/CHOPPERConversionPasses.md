### `-convert-basicpy-to-std`: Convert representable Basicpy ops to std
### `-convert-numpy-to-tcf`: Convert the numpy dialect to supported TCF ops
### `-convert-tcf-to-linalg`: Convert TCF to Linalg
The intention is for this pass to convert mainly to linalg named ops.

Because linalg is at the "TCP" layer of abstraction, this pass has to
concern itself with generating guards for error cases.
