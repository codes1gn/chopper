    We have a specialized dialect `refbackrt` which models our runtime's data

// folding to the specified dialects as well.
// Perhaps a better design is having a pass that uses the conversion framework.
// The the pass constructor would take a set of op names, and it would
// set up a conversion target that makes all those ops illegal, and uses
// the canonicalization patterns from those ops to legalize them.

    This pass is the same as the regular `canonicalize` pass, but it only
    applies a restricted set of patterns.

    This is useful when a particular canonicalization is actually needed for
    correctness of a lowering flow. For such cases, running a restricted set of
    canonicalizations makes it clearer which passes are needed for correctness
    and which passes are "just optimizations". This helps when debugging
    miscompiles and other situations where the compiler is not behaving as
    expected.
